### Code Explaination

Refer to [/webapp/view/App.view.xml](https://github.com/VaibhavMojidra/SAP-UI5---Demo-Icons/blob/master/webapp/view/App.view.xml "App.view.xml")

We add an icon to the button that opens the dialog. The sap-icon:// protocol is indicating that an icon from the icon font should be loaded. The identifier world is the readable name of the icon in the icon font.

Refer to [/webapp/view/IconDialog.fragment.xml](https://github.com/VaibhavMojidra/SAP-UI5---Demo-Icons/blob/master/webapp/view/IconDialog.fragment.xml "IconDialog.fragment.xml")

In the dialog fragment, we add an icon control to the content aggregation of the dialog.
